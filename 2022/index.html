														<h3>The Ten Year Anniversary of HackOHI/O Teams up with The Ohio Stadium's 100th year celebration!</h3>
														<p>Posted <time datetime="2022-09-14">September 14, 2022</time></p>
													</div>
													<div class="announcement-content">
														<p>OHI/O and the Athletics department are teaming up to offer students a chance envision the future of the Ohio Stadium. The iconic stadium on the banks of the Olentangy River has been the site of 100 years of games, commencement ceremonies, concerts and, for all Buckeye fans, memories. "Ohio Stadium holds a special place in the hearts of all Buckeyes and it is a place of historic significance," said President Kristina M. Johnson. To celebrate that history and craft an enduring future, the Ohio Stadium must evolve and grow to meet the needs of its community.</p>
														<p>At HackOHI/O, students in a variety of majors will envision the future of tech at the 'Shoe. They'll look for ways to use technology to transform the fan experience. HackOHI/O is Ohio State's signature hackathon, drawing nearly 800 students to ideate, design and demo innovative ideas during a 24 hour invention marathon. From its inception in the library basement with fewer than 100 participants to the weekend of activities that now occupies the Ohio Union, HackOHI/O has come along way in the last ten year. Teams now compete for their piece of $10,000 in prizes and ongoing entrepreneurial support from the Keenan Center for Entrepreneurship.</p>
														<p>How could you use technology to improve or transform the Ohio Stadium's visitor experience? Full challenge details will be released at the event, October 8th. Register for Hack and join a team of passionate folks eager to show the 'Shoe what you can do!</p>

									<h2>FAQ</h2>
								</header>

								<div class="faq-container">

										<button class="faq-accordion">What is a hackathon?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in 
												technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of
												 a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don't have to be a programmer, and
												  you certainly don't have to be majoring in Computer Science. (Definition adapted from 
												  MLH organizer guide).

											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">Will the hackathon be virtual?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												This year we will be hosting a hybrid event that is virtual and in-person. While 
												we encourage teams to attend in person, there are ways for students, sponsors, and 
												mentors to join us virtually and still participate. It is imperative that all participants,
												regardless of in-person or virtual status, join the HackOHI/O Discord server to get access 
												to all the event-specific details. The join link will be sent in a confirmation email after 
												the registration form has been completed. 
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">How does a virtual hackathon work?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												Everything will work as before but be virtualized using different technologies. There will 
												still be access to mentors, sponsors and other hackers. If you plan to attend virtually, 
												be sure to join the HackOHI/O X Discord for pertinent updates when you receive an invitation. 
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">Who can attend?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												Anyone who is a student at a university! (AKA if you have a .edu email address, undergrads and 
												grad students are both welcome). We encourage all levels of expertise to join. Whether this 
												is your first hackathon, or you've been to hackathons around the nation, HackOHI/O provides 
												an opportunity to collaborate and create something amazing. 
												<br>
												Note, unfortunately, if you are under the age of 18 AND you are not an OSU student you 
												are not eligible to participate (OSU Policy). However, if you are an OSU student under the 
												age of 18, you are eligible to participate. Likewise, if you are not an OSU student AND you are 
												over the age of 18, you are eligible to participate.

											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">How does registration work?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												The registration for HackOHI/O 2022 is open! Register by
												<a href="https://go.osu.edu/registerhack/" rel="noopener nonreferrer">clicking here</a>.
												Since we are planning to provide free meals for those who participate in-person,
												we will also send a short confirmation email a week before the event. If you have
												any questions about the registration process, contact
												<a href="mailto:registerhackohio@gmail.com">registerhackohio@gmail.com</a>.
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">How do I join a team?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												You can pick a team to join in the Discord Server. Teams can be anywhere from 2-4 members, and we require 
												for all participants to be in a team to be eligible for judging. If you are looking for a team, we'll 
												be providing opportunities before and during the hackathon to find one. We'll be posting more 
												information on team formation events in our newsletters and on our social media accounts - be on the lookout!
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">What if I have no programming experience?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												That's okay! One of the goals of a hackathon is to learn new skills, and we will have mentors available
												to help you throughout your project. We will also host workshops prior to the hackathon to introduce
												you to new programming languages and/or tools. And remember, there are other ways to help out a team 
												in their development beyond programming.
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">Is it free?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												Yes, this event is free for all participants! We would like to thank our generous sponsors and supporters
												for making this possible.
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">Do I need to have an idea beforehand?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												Nope! Many participants come up with their ideas at the hackathon. Challenges presented by our sponsors 
												will be released the week before the event, which also spark idea formation (and the chance for additional prizes!)
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">Can I work on my project before this event?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												The spirit of a hackathon is to see what you can accomplish in one weekend. Although we will not prevent students
												from entering with pre-built components, when you enter your project for judging we ask that you are honest
												and transparent with the judges about what and how much was accomplished during HackOHI/O. 
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">How can I help?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												HackOHI/O provides opportunities for industry and academic professionals to work directly with students. <br><br>

												<b>Mentors</b> will assist participants throughout the event with any questions or concerns they may have while 
												creating their project. We welcome individuals with knowledge and expertise in various topics to help mentor students at HackOHI/O. 
												This year, mentors can participate both virtually and in-person. <br><br>

												<b>Judges</b> will help us score teams on October 9th by reviewing their projects in the form of a video submission and live discussion 
												with the teams. This year, judges will be virtual only. If you are interested in attending the event in-person and want to judge, 
												please sign up to be a mentor as well. <br><br>

										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">Will there still be swag?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												Yes there will! Swag pick-up will happen as you enter HackOHI/O the morning of October 8th. Unfortunately, OHI/O is 
												unable to ship swag to virtual participants. However, virtual participants who win awards will have prizes shipped to them.
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">What if I can't pick up swag myself, can someone else grab it for me?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												Yes! Just mention the person who will pick-up for you in the comments on your signup, or let an organizer know.
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">What about hardware hacks?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												This year, the Electronics club will be providing basic materials for the event in-person. You are more 
												than welcome to still build with your own materials!
											</p>
										</div>

										<button class="faq-accordion">Wow, this all sounds so great! Who hosts HackOHI/O?</button>
										<div class="faq-question">
											<p>
												HackOHI/O is hosted by OHI/O, an Ohio State student organization. Check out our other events at hack.osu.edu. Sign up for our 
												<a href="https://lists.osu.edu/mailman/listinfo/osuhackathons">mailing list</a> to keep up to date with our activities).
